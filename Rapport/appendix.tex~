\section{Code}
Below follow the scripts used for numerical simulation of the described dumbbell system,
all written in Python.
The code is divided into three files: one containing the tools for constructing the
external magnetic fields used, one containing the tools used to integrate the dynamics
within some such field and one main script for setting parameters and calling the necessary
functions from the two other modules. To execute properly all three .py - files must be
placed in the same folder additionally containing a subfolder named ''saves'', and that
subfolder must in turn contain three subfolders ''fields'', ''odesols'' and ''graphs''.
