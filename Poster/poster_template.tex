    Basic principle and premise
   \end{beamercolorbox}
   Magnetism always appears in dual form. Any size of ''magnet'' must have at least two poles, much like a common bar
   magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Imagine splitting such a bar magnet in twine, would two pieces of different
   magnetic ''charge'' be the result, one block of pure ''north'' and one of pure
   ''south''?    \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
           \centering
           \includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth]{magnetslice}
           \label{fig:magnets}
   \end{wrapfigure}
   That would be what is called magnetic monopoles, but such 
   things have yet never been observed, the bar magnet will split into two smaller bar
   magnets. 
   Other things in nature \textit{appear} to be monopoles even though they are not, and it
   is this kind of monopole which is studied here.
   This project concerns the modelling and simulation of a certain system with certain
   properties, such that its motion appears to be affected by a magnetic monopole.

           \item Consider two masses connected by a massless stick, like a 
                   dumbbell for weight lifting.
           \item Both masses have spin, a quantum bar magnet rotating about each end of
                   the dumbbell in a quirky ''quantum way''.
           \item The dumbbells are thrown into a magnetic field, how will they move and
                   rotate?
           \item Simulations were done for a magnetic field generated by two square coils,
                   as above.
           \item The red grid is the volume simulated.
           \item The blue dot marks a point of zero magnetic field, where a synthetic
                   monopole emits a synthetic magnetic
                   field.
           \item This synthetic field is \textbf{not} the ''regular'' field generated by
                   the coils.
           \item Both fields affect the dumbbell motion.
